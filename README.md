# Arduino_Security_System
Arduino-based home security system with PIR motion detection, LED armed indicator, and buzzer alarm.

This project implements a simple home security system using Arduino. 
It features:

- **PIR Motion Sensor**: detects intruders
- **LED**: indicates armed or disarmed state
- **Buzzer**: sounds alarm when motion is detected and system is armed
- **Push Button**: manually arm or disarm the system

The system uses logic to ensure the alarm only triggers when armed, 
and includes button debounce to prevent false triggers. 
This project is implemented and tested in Tinkercad for simulation.
